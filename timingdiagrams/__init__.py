        Notes
        =====
        Uses a orderedcollections.SortedDict for storing pairs.
        The input states can be any truthy/falsey values.
        The input times can be any type with a partial ordering.
        The input sequence does not need to be sorted (input is sorted during initialization).
        Compresses duplicate sequential states and stores them in the timeline attribute.

        Example
        =======
        >>> diagram = TimingDiagram([(0, True), (1, False), (5, False), (10, True)])
        >>> print(~diagram)
        TimingDiagram([(0, False), (1, True), (5, True), (10, False)])
